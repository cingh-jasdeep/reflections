When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

a remote repository can be used when using from multiple computers or when collaborating with many people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
manual pull is good if the source code changes on remote and we are still working on in the local copy.
the pull will help us merge these changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks help clone repositories within github servers
clones help copy repositories from one location to another
branches help create labelled commits in a repository

when cloning repositories on github servers we should use forks
when copying repositories locally or between local and remote we should use clones
when creating a labelled commit we should use branches

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
benefit for having a copy of last known state of remote is that one can build upon that state locally
and merge later when online.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
collaborate withou git or github could be done by one manager manually checking for changes in each collaboraters files.
using git or github is infinitely easier to collaborate.
