What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git folder is created. It is necessary to start using git in the repository folder.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is where you can untracked files to be ready for commit
working directory contains all files whether staged or not staged
repository contains committed files only

staging helps us organise files before being put on repository
