When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

a remote repository can be used when using from multiple computers or when collaborating with many people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
manual pull is good if the source code changes on remote and we are still working on in the local copy.
the pull will help us merge these changes.
